# a-simple-emacs-config

My personal basic configuration of GNU Emacs. 

# Requirements

- Martin Mono Nerd Font

## Stuff to know if you decide to use my config

- I used the built-in package manager (**package.el)
- **org-bullets** are customized to my personal taste, so feel free to change them :)
- Un-comment menu-bar and tool-bar lines under Display Settings in the config.org file, if you're confident using Emacs keybindings.

## Installed Packages

Magit, which-key, toc-org, org-bullets, Emmet.

## Future Additions

I'm learning web development, so I might add: Flycheck, outline-indent, indent-bars, undo-tree.

org-roam, ace-window.
