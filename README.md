# a-simple-emacs-config

My first Emacs configuration, so it's very basic and simple. But that's its strength.

- I used the built-in package manager (**package.el**)
- **org-bullets** are customized to my personal taste, so feel free change them :)
- If you're confident using Emacs keybindings, feel free to un-comment menu-bar and tool-bar commands at Display Settings in the config.org file.

...and that's it. You're basically getting vanilla Emacs.
